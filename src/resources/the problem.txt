
    The problem with asymptotic analysis is that it is difficult to predict
    the exact value for the running time for algorithms because constants 
    are ignored. The time complexity of the algorithm in relation to the 
    change in input size is what is considered in this analysis technique. 
    
    Which is why it is best to use a method for analyzing the actual running
    time of algorithms based on the size of the input. The algorithms can 
    then be analyzed and compared based on their running time 
    performance in relation to various input sizes. This analyses technique
    is known as empirical analysis.
